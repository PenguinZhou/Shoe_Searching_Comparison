29708 14346 1 2 2 Shoe B is shorter and has a wider opening
29708 14346 1 1 1 a has fur on the top which makes your feat feel swallowed

38629 24247 1 1 3 Shoe a and b are almost the same shoe.
38629 24247 1 2 2 B seems to be slightly more open than A, but both are fairly the same.
38629 24247 1 1 2 A has a slightly wider ankle
38629 24247 1 1 3 Both are very similar so it is hard to choose. 
38629 24247 1 2 3 same
28537 46688 1 2 2 Lower on ankle 
28537 46688 1 2 3 Neither shoe is open.  
28537 46688 1 1 2 Show A is slight dipper
28537 46688 1 2 2 The tongue in shoe B seems smaller.
28537 46688 1 2 2 From my perspective it would seem Shoe B is more open but i'm not 100% sure.
3512 18490 1 2 1 Shoe b has less strap coverage then shoe a by a little bit.
3512 18490 1 2 2 vey nice open concept in both pair
3512 18490 1 2 1 There is less fabric on the thong part which to me makes it more open
3512 18490 1 2 1 the straps on shoe b are slimmer making it more 'open than shoe a.

39002 46574 1 2 2 The sneakers cover less of the leg than the boots. 
39002 46574 1 2 2 Sit lower on the foot.
39002 46574 1 2 1 Shoe A covers the ankle as well as the foot.
39002 46574 1 2 1 Shoe A is all about ankle support - to a fault. All that padding and velcro makes it look like the kind of boot you wear to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. Shoe B looks like the kind of shoe I could wear every day, with a nice open ankle design.
38407 18249 1 1 1 Shoe A has two little vents up by the toe.
38407 18249 1 1 2 TO SIMILAR IN DESIGN BUT B LOOKS LESS RESTRICTIVE.
38407 18249 1 1 2 Because it looks roomier
38407 18249 1 2 3 Both shoes look like they have the same amount of coverage to me, but shoe B might have a slightly lower tongue. It is difficult to say.
38407 18249 1 2 3 It's hard to tell, but shoe B seems to be a little wider at the entrance, making it more open.
13034 34384 1 1 2 Shoe A looks like it has more air space in the opening.
13034 34384 1 2 2 b is more open
13034 34384 1 1 3 Both shoes are not very open. The angle for Shoe A makes it look slightly more open. 
13034 34384 1 2 1 pointy tip
13034 34384 1 1 1 Shoe A looks wider and more open at the mouth and the toes.
29920 19821 1 2 1 Shoe b has less strap coverage then shoe a.
29920 19821 1 2 1 Shoe B has a somewhat open back, whereas shoe A does not.  
29920 19821 1 1 2 This sandal seems to have more space between the strap and where the foot would be, making it appear more open.
29920 19821 1 2 1 Again, B covers less skin, particularly in the heel in this case.
29920 19821 1 2 1 Shoe A is closed at the heel. Shoe B is open at the heel. 
15648 20319 1 2 2 Shorter shaft
15648 20319 1 1 1 no laces
15648 20319 1 1 2 Can just slip in and out versus tying your shoes.
15648 20319 1 2 2 Shoe B seems less rigid.

24681 32228 1 1 2 Lower shaft
24681 32228 1 2 2 Both of these shoes seem to come up about the same amount on the leg, but I chose Shoe B because it does not have laces and would be easier to put on and take off.
24681 32228 1 1 1 No heel
24681 32228 1 2 1 The shoe is more sloped, and the toe is more triangular, compared to Shoe A's rounded toe. 
24681 32228 1 2 3 about the same
45035 4354 1 2 2 B looks like it would be lower on the ankle.
45035 4354 1 2 2 The color of Shoe A seems to draw it in and close it up, as opposed to the white colore of Shoe B.
45035 4354 1 2 3 neither look open
45035 4354 1 1 1 I've worn similar shoes. Shoe B is more open due to it's thicker/more cushiony design.
45035 4354 1 2 1 Shoe B has a larger opening.
46049 24466 1 1 2 Lower shaft
46049 24466 1 1 3 Again, pretty much equally un-open
46049 24466 1 1 1 Shorter, looser design
46049 24466 1 1 1 Sneaker appearance, looks softer.

49763 45524 1 2 2 Shoe B has slightly thinner straps
49763 45524 1 2 2 B appears to have more space between the sole and straps
49763 45524 1 2 2 Shoe B just appears in the picture to have more space for the toes than shoe A. I'm not absolutely positive though.
49763 45524 1 2 2 Shoe B's straps are slightly narrower.
49763 45524 1 2 1 b appears less restricting
42109 22330 1 1 1 it is open toe...
42109 22330 1 1 1 Shoe A has a peep hole, where as shoe b is closed.
42109 22330 1 2 2 the other seems tight
42109 22330 1 1 1 Shoe A has an open toe area so there is more open room. 
42109 22330 1 1 1 The top of the foor will be open in both, but shoe A has open toes.
41910 47876 1 2 1 Shoe b shows more leg then shoe a.
41910 47876 1 1 1 Shoe A is shorter therefore making it more open
41910 47876 1 1 1 Much lower top. Looks like it might be more open in the back too. 
41910 47876 1 1 1 Shoe A covers less of the leg than the large cowboy boot.
41910 47876 1 1 1 shoe a is shorter so it shows more calf
19453 22325 1 1 1 A appears looser
19453 22325 1 1 1 A appears to have a lower ankle and heel back than does B.
19453 22325 1 1 2 Shoe A appears as though it would have better ventilation.
19453 22325 1 1 2 Shoe A is more loosely fitted so it would be more open.
19453 22325 1 1 1 Shoe A has a slightly wider opening
2318 13118 1 2 3 Shoe A has a reinforced rubber toe 
2318 13118 1 1 1 A is less form fitting
2318 13118 1 1 1 A has a wider neck
2318 13118 1 1 2 Shoe b cannot be adjusted.
2318 13118 1 2 2 Shoe B has a wider opening
47874 2103 1 2 2 Lower shaft
47874 2103 1 2 3 neither are open concept
47874 2103 1 2 2 Shoe b doesn't seem to cover as much of the leg as shoe a.
47874 2103 1 2 2 Shoe b looks more open in that it looks more roomy in the toe and wide all around.
47874 2103 1 2 2 the curl up in shoe a made me pick b
29003 17577 1 1 3 Shoe a is more exposed at the top then shoe b.
29003 17577 1 2 3 Shoe A has laces which can be a little more conforming if chosen to tighten. Not much adjusting around the actual foot on shoe B. 
29003 17577 1 2 1 Shoe A is a work boot
29003 17577 1 2 1 Just because it's shorter.
29003 17577 1 1 2 Laces allow it to open wider
49568 3067 1 1 2 Shoe A is slightly more open.
49568 3067 1 1 1 Shoe A is a slip on while B has ties and straps
49568 3067 1 1 2 no straps compared to shoe b
49568 3067 1 1 2 Both shoes aren't very open but A is more open than B.
49568 3067 1 1 1 Shoe A will show the top of the foot and ankle. While shoe B will only show the ankle.
11862 14258 1 1 2 Shoe A exposes the ankle more than shoe B
11862 14258 1 1 1 Shoe as has more open area around the ankle than shoe B.
11862 14258 1 1 1 You can undo the straps and pull the tongue of the shoe away to make a bigger opening where shoe b only had the one opening.  
11862 14258 1 1 2 Shoe A looks like it is made of a canvas type material which generally breathes pretty well. It also has velcro which allow the wearer to adjust how open the shoe is.
11862 14258 1 1 2 Both seem equally open, But the sneaker seems like it would have the edge over Shoe B. Are velcros really becoming a fashion trend? Ugh.
11695 42147 1 2 2 The laces look more relaxed, allowing an easy slip on and off.
11695 42147 1 1 1 Shoe A looks very loose and roomy, whereas Shoe B looks form-fitting. 
11695 42147 1 1 1 wider
11695 42147 1 1 2 Shoe A looks like it would be more open.  More room to give you feet room to breath.
11695 42147 1 1 2 Shoe B doesn't cover as much of your feet. 
9386 20936 1 1 2 A may be lower on the ankle
9386 20936 1 1 3 they seem about the same
9386 20936 1 1 3 Both look kind of the same.
9386 20936 1 1 1 Shoe A is shorter and exposes more of the top of the foot
9386 20936 1 1 2 Shoe A is lighter and doesn't cover the ankle while Shoe B slightly does.
10033 3127 1 1 1 Shoe A seems smaller and cover less of the foot than shoe B making it appear more open.
10033 3127 1 2 2 This one was kind of difficult.  Shoe A looks as though it has vent holes in the top, which could be considered a bit open.  However, the hole for the foot looks as though it would cover the ankle more so than that of Shoe B, so I picked Shoe B.
10033 3127 1 1 1 Shoe A has holes in it
10033 3127 1 1 3 Shoe A seems to have less material on it, thus making it more open?
10033 3127 1 2 2 Shoe B is larger, which is kind of like being more open.
42634 26289 1 2 1 Because of the heel pushing the leg up I think Shoe B would be more open because it leaves more of the calf exposed.
42634 26289 1 1 1 A would come up to below the knee, and B come up to or over the knee
42634 26289 1 1 3 Neither shoe is open
42634 26289 1 1 3 More colorful, more open I suppose.
42634 26289 1 1 1 The relaxed feel of the boot and wide opening give this boot a more open look.
24112 19941 1 1 2 Lower shaft allows more skin to be exposed
24112 19941 1 1 2 A has less of a ankle support. 
24112 19941 1 1 1 Shoe A is shorter
24112 19941 1 1 1 Shoe A would have to be considered more open than Shoe B. I think the low cut ankle and laceup shoe strings give it an open feel more so than Shoe B knee high boot. 
24112 19941 1 1 1 Shoe B has a much more elongated, enclosed space about itself.
26404 31539 1 2 3 Opening on B may be rigid and thus be more open.
26404 31539 1 1 1 Boots are very tough and hard, and when I think open I think shoes that allow me movement.
26404 31539 1 1 1 A covers less of your foot/leg
26404 31539 1 1 1 Shoe A looks more comfortable, while B would be useful for hiking and outside activities.
26404 31539 1 1 2 A fits lower on the leg.
20324 48225 1 2 1 Shoe b is wider at the top then shoe a.
20324 48225 1 1 1 B is a sack to cover a shoe in the snow and would be very closed to keep out the cold
20324 48225 1 1 1 Shoe A has lace holes.
20324 48225 1 2 1 The calf size on shoe b is wider.
20324 48225 1 2 2 Shoe B looks very loose and Shoe A is very rigid.
20850 39325 1 1 1 shoe a covers less of the leg
20850 39325 1 1 1 Shoe B looks like a full armor boot that takes an hour to put on.
20850 39325 1 1 1 B is more like a boot so A is more open
20850 39325 1 1 1 Shoe a doesnt cover the ankles 
20850 39325 1 1 2 Shoe A doesn't cover as much area.
6137 15198 1 1 1 Shoe a reveals more ankle then shoe b.
6137 15198 1 1 2 Shoe A appears to have more open space 
6137 15198 1 1 2 A has a wider ankle
6137 15198 1 1 1 Shoe A doesn't have as much covering the top of the foot as Shoe B.
6137 15198 1 2 1 Shoe B exposes a little more of the ankle
40321 27568 1 2 2 More skin would be exposed 
40321 27568 1 1 3 about the same
40321 27568 1 2 1 shape of the point make me choose B as more open than shoe A
40321 27568 1 1 2 Shoe A exposes slightly more of the foot
40321 27568 1 2 3 Both these shoes seem equally open to me as they are the same style dress shoe. These both slip on so I would say they are equally open.
50002 29972 1 2 2 The top half of shoe b is more open 
50002 29972 1 2 1 Shoe B is shorter
50002 29972 1 2 1 Shoe b Does is not closed up your shins as far as shoe a
50002 29972 1 2 2 Shoe B is slightly less restrictive than Shoe A, so I would say it is more open. The tops of Shoe B fold down to reveal the ankle, whereas Shoe A is tight around the ankle and leg until the top. 
50002 29972 1 2 2 Folded material looks more open
35448 35613 1 2 1 Shoe B is much lower on the leg than the boot of Shoe A.
35448 35613 1 2 2 Shoe B has a broader opening at the top. 
35448 35613 1 2 1 Shoe B allows fr adjustment in fit.
35448 35613 1 1 2 boots tend to be a looser fit
35448 35613 1 2 1 The strap makes it more open.
4783 34423 1 1 1 Shoe A is shorter
4783 34423 1 1 2 Shoe A has a wider ankle
4783 34423 1 1 1 Shoe B appears to be a high top sneaker, whereas shoe A is a standard sneaker.  By definition, a high top style sneaker closes off a larger portion of the foot/ankle.  
4783 34423 1 2 1 the design of B offers slightly more breathing room than A
4783 34423 1 1 1 covers less.
2045 39860 1 1 1 More airy and room to breathe
2045 39860 1 1 2 B has a protruding tongue
2045 39860 1 2 2 Shoe B is able to be untied and loosened around the ankle/calf/upper foot. Shoe A is not able to be adjusted in anyway therefore Shoe B is more open
2045 39860 1 1 1 Looks like this one would feel looser and more open.
2045 39860 1 1 3 Both are open
18087 5892 1 1 2 Shoe B is a high-top style.
18087 5892 1 1 1 Shoe A opens at the ankle whereas shoe B covers more of the ankle
18087 5892 1 1 1 Shoe B comes up farther on the ankle than Shoe A.

18363 21903 1 1 2 slightly moor open style
18363 21903 1 2 3 the same
18363 21903 1 2 2 Shoe B seems to have a larger opening for the foot, therefore leaving a bit more of the top of the foot exposed.  This indicates a more open shoe to me.  
18363 21903 1 2 1 Shoe B appears to let more air in and out than Shoe A.
41418 19309 1 2 1 Shoe B is slightly more open than Shoe A, it comes up a little lower on the ankle than Shoe A.
41418 19309 1 2 1 more ankle shown

2116 35934 1 2 2 Lower on ankle
2116 35934 1 2 1 B is more open
2116 35934 1 2 1 Shoe B because it is shorter
2116 35934 1 2 3 Both shoes appear equally closed in that none of the foot is exposed.
2116 35934 1 1 3 They both look like they aren't very open at all.
22498 30517 1 1 1 neither are very open but a is lower so it is more open
22498 30517 1 1 1 easy to put on. 
22498 30517 1 1 1 Shoe A is shorter 
22498 30517 1 1 1 Shoe A is more open because it doesn't cover the calf.
22498 30517 1 1 1 B come half way up a person calf
20067 17439 1 2 3 Shoe B has only one strap covering the foot. Shoe A has multiple covering straps.
20067 17439 1 2 1 Shoe B covers less of the foot/ankle.
20067 17439 1 1 2 The higher supports make it seem more open.
20067 17439 1 2 1 It has less straps.
20067 17439 1 2 1 Shoe A is a sandal with a strap. The strap does not convey open to me
24321 27398 1 1 1 Shoe A doesn't rise as high on the foot as Shoe B.
24321 27398 1 1 2 Lower on the ankle
24321 27398 1 2 1 Shoe b shows more ankle then shoe a.
24321 27398 1 1 1 Shoe A is a slip-on style that has a shorter tongue and a breathable fabric for the material.
24321 27398 1 1 1 Shoe A is more open because it is a slip on.
43637 276 1 2 1 Shoe b is exposed at he back and around the ankle area.
43637 276 1 2 1 Picked B because the whole back of the foot is exposed.
43637 276 1 2 1 Back is open
43637 276 1 2 1 Shoe B is more open than Shoe A because all you have to do is slip your foot into this shoe, verses shoe A, with Shoe A you have to apply more pressure and movement to place your foot inside of the shoe. Shoe B allows for easy taking off and putting on, plus the foot can breath more with this shoe verses with Shoe A.
43637 276 1 2 1 It is a slip on shoe without a back
23364 11889 1 2 2 Lower on the ankle

23364 11889 1 2 1 Shoe B has a lower ankle, making it more open.
20477 24052 1 1 2 Lower shaft
20477 24052 1 1 3 In comparison to both boots, I would say Shoe A is more open because it has to be laced as opposed to the traditional boot (Shoe B).
20477 24052 1 2 3 Shoe B has a tiny bit of an opening at the top and seems like it would be more considered open
20477 24052 1 1 2 Because shoes A have cords
20477 24052 1 2 1 Shoe B is a slip on and looks pretty loose around the leg
1737 27061 1 2 1 They both are pretty closed up but since B has less laces so I pick that one.
1737 27061 1 1 2 Exposes more skin
1737 27061 1 1 1 Shoe a reveals more ankle then shoe b.
1737 27061 1 1 1 Shoe A has a wider opening that exposes more of the ankle area

21572 33073 1 1 1 B sits higher on the foot

4687 7203 1 2 1 The height of Shoe B makes it more open.

48160 2393 1 1 1 it is open toe
48160 2393 1 1 1 Shoe A has a peep hole for the toes where as shoe b is a sneaker
48160 2393 1 2 2 other pair is too narrow

6128 39195 1 1 3 Shoe A has a wider opening for placing the foot in than Shoe B. Shoe A I can see how the foot would easily slide into the shoe verses shoe B, you'd have to undo shoe laces to place the foot in more easily, especially for someone with a wider foot.

24156 23241 1 1 1 the laces and open top makes it more open at the top.

37325 5320 1 2 1 shoe 1 are cleets and feet dont breathe

1787 49453 1 2 2 They look to be the same as far as openess goes.
1787 49453 1 2 1 Both shoes are technically open, but the term makes me think more casual, and Shoe B - being a slipper - is far more casual, or open than Shoe A, which probably exposes about as much of the foot as Shoe B, but it's more formal design (note the high heel) makes it feel less open.

15906 13801 1 2 1 A looks like it would be way to hot 
15906 13801 1 1 2 Neither shoe is more open. Shoe A would be less open due to not having laces

6067 38890 1 2 1 A boot without laces has a more open feel than any shoe with laces.

19458 6373 1 1 3 the same
19458 6373 1 1 1 Shoe A because the heel has a cutout
19458 6373 1 1 1 Shoe A appears to not have a solid surface.

26690 23419 1 1 1 Very open
26690 23419 1 1 2 A has a wider neck
26690 23419 1 2 3 about the same
26690 23419 1 2 1 Shoe B is more opened because Shoe A has a more of a point and shoe b doesn't have a point.
26690 23419 1 1 2 Shoe A has a wider opening
3938 15227 1 1 1 nice
3938 15227 1 1 1 Shoe B is basically designed to be closed since it is a winter boot. Shoe A is more open, even though it is as closed as a regular shoe.

3938 15227 1 1 1 low ankle

32934 4760 1 2 1 Neither shoe have any open spaces, but Shoe B does not come as high on the leg as Shoe A.
32934 4760 1 2 1 B is a slip on shoe that is built to be more open.
32934 4760 1 2 1 Shoe B is shorter
32934 4760 1 2 1 The design of shoe A rises at the toe, this in my experience means that they will have less room on the inside.
32934 4760 1 2 3 Both holes are similar
26165 39089 1 1 2 Lower shaft
26165 39089 1 1 2 I Choose Shoe A as a more open shoe because it has the ability to be laced. Also, it does not run up to the knee like Shoe B does. 
26165 39089 1 2 3 It seems like it would be considered more open than the other one. 
26165 39089 1 2 1 Because shoes B have buttons

34172 14665 1 2 2 Shoe B, the hiking boot, has no heel and therefore lets your foot rest in a more natural position. I think the heeled boot would be more confining and less open to wear.

34993 30340 1 2 1 Shoe B is shorter and has a wider opening

15879 31985 1 1 1 Shoe A is made of softer and more flexible material, and has no laces so it is more open.
9607 864 1 1 1 The hole in A looks larger
9607 864 1 1 3 In my opinion, both shoes are the same level of openness, but I chose A because the colors are lighter, and more open in an abstract sense.
9607 864 1 1 3 looks wider, cant hardly tell there shoes
9607 864 1 1 3 Can't really tell

9531 23378 1 1 1 Shoe a shows more ankle then shoe b.
9531 23378 1 1 1 B goes up the ankle.
9531 23378 1 1 1 B goes up too high to be considered open.
9531 23378 1 1 1 Shoe b wares up to the ankle.
19296 32949 1 1 3 A would probably feel a bit roomier, but neither is open.
19296 32949 1 1 3 Shoe A is shorter and has laces
19296 32949 1 2 2 the boot has a larger opening at the top
19296 32949 1 1 2 Shoe B looks constrictive and not open

2067 6212 1 1 1 B has leg coverage
2067 6212 1 1 1 Shoe B would hit the leg above the ankle or even mid-calf if it's a children's shoe.  Shoe A is much more open because it is an ankle shoe.

43060 35871 1 2 2 B just looks more open.
43060 35871 1 2 2 Shoe B exposes more of the foot
41491 48369 1 1 1 Shoe a shows more leg then shoe b.
41491 48369 1 1 2 This bootie would cover less of your leg.
41491 48369 1 1 1 B rises higher up the leg.
41491 48369 1 1 1 Shoe A is more open than shoe B because shoe a is a bootie where as shoe B is a boot that sits half way up the calf, making it more constricting.

9666 35404 1 2 2 B has a lower shaft.

9666 35404 1 2 1 A is a full boot, B is a ankle boot
9666 35404 1 2 1 Shoe a goes all the way up the leg while shoe b just goes to the ankle.

13849 19675 1 2 1 Shoe A has a smaller foot opening and rides slightly higher on the ankle.
13849 19675 1 2 2 shoe b seems to have a slightly lower profile on the ankle/lower leg
13849 19675 1 2 1 The shoe is wider therefore more room and more open than shoe A.

33953 37181 1 1 2 Shoe a seems a little wider and open.
33953 37181 1 1 1 Shoe A appears to be more open at the top than shoe B.  
33953 37181 1 1 1 Shoe A has a wider opening
33953 37181 1 1 3 They both have similar openness so this one is a total toss up.
4679 42145 1 1 1 Shoe A doesn't come as far up the ankle.
4679 42145 1 1 1 Shoe A is shorter and has a wider opening

4679 42145 1 1 1 Shoe A is an easy off/on with the pull of a strap, where as shoe B would require tying, untying, adjusting laces, etc.
4124 36645 1 2 1 I picked shoe B because it does not have buckles (hence it would be looser on the leg).
4124 36645 1 1 3 Same. But ments tall boots are usually utilitarian so possibly taller.
4124 36645 1 2 2 Shoe B looks slightly more open because Shoe A has several tight buckles up the length.
4124 36645 1 1 3 Both shoes seem comparable in their opening at the top. I am unsure what else would be considered as open.
4124 36645 1 1 3 neither is really open

41446 48436 1 2 1 Shoe b shows more leg on the side then shoe a.
41446 48436 1 2 2 Shoe B is shorter and has a wider opening, plus the material is looser
41446 48436 1 2 1 These shoes are boots, and have very similar restrictive openings.  However, Shoe B looks more lax at the mouth and therefore perhaps somewhat more open than Shoe A.
41446 48436 1 1 2 only because shoe A has laces.
8911 907 1 2 1 B has holes in it; definitely more open
8911 907 1 2 1 Shoe B has actual holes in it, and an open back.

25053 21218 1 1 1 Shoe a exposes more ankle then shoe b.

31809 23649 1 1 3 I can't see the top of Shoe A, but it doesn't look to be made of rubber like shoe B, so it is probably more open.  It also looks a little shorter.

34966 24379 1 2 1 looks like shoe B has some elastic allowing more openness. 
34966 24379 1 2 1 Shoe B is shorter so covering less leg.
29510 39387 1 1 1 Shoe A is a lower profile so less of the foot is covered.
29510 39387 1 1 1 SHoe A looks more sporty to me.
29510 39387 1 1 1 The lighter material and less coverage of the shoe makes it appear more open.

29510 39387 1 1 2 Shoe a looks like it has more room.
48219 1473 1 1 3 Neither shoe is open.

48219 1473 1 2 1 I chose B because I don't even know what A is.
48219 1473 1 2 3 Shoe A looks like it is meant for horses.  I am confused by it actually.
48219 1473 1 1 3 I don't even know what that is.
35751 1434 1 2 2 Shoe A is taller and seems as if it would fit tighter, which leaves less of of an open area.
35751 1434 1 2 3 they're closed shoes to me. No difference.
35751 1434 1 1 2 the leather seems more maleable

48054 21588 1 1 1 A has more open areas and does not have straps on the heel. 
48054 21588 1 1 1 Shoe A has a completely exposed heel
48054 21588 1 2 1 Shoe B is more of an open concept because there is very minimal coverage.
48054 21588 1 1 1 Shoe B still has a strap in the back behind your heel, as well as one of those annoying strips between your toes. Whereas the belt buckle sandal is just that, belt buckles and openness.
13071 34405 1 2 3 Appear to be the same, B may be more slightly open
13071 34405 1 1 2 Shoe B seems thicker, and therefore less mobile and more warm.

30197 43673 1 1 1 Shoe A is shorter

26045 29890 1 1 2 Shoe A looks more open because of the ease of putting it on, verses Shoe B, which Shoe B looks like it would take more effort to put on because of the design and large shoe tongue that's in front.
26045 29890 1 1 1 It has laces and is not a high top

15157 1908 1 1 1 Tennis shoes are more open, comfortable, than the multi laced one. 
31050 27114 1 1 1 A has a narrow neck
31050 27114 1 2 3 Since Shoe B has laces, it looks more open
31050 27114 1 2 1 Shoe B laces which is why it is more open.
31050 27114 1 1 2 I would say A only because they slid on.

32820 41014 1 2 1 Most likely to be worn

2849 18010 1 2 3 Shoe B seems wider than shoe A.
2849 18010 1 1 3 They both seem to be very open. Not much difference. The only reason I choose A is the point of view the picture was taken at leaves me to believe the part that connects the shoe between the toes is slightly further back on the foot. 
2849 18010 1 2 3 It is hard to compare the openness, but Shoe B looks larger with a roomier heel area. 
2849 18010 1 1 2 Shoe A appears to have slightly thinner straps
6108 33273 1 1 3 Equal
6108 33273 1 1 3 Neither shoe is really open.

11176 15281 1 2 3 They look similar in how the boot conforms to your foot, so unable to say one if more open for the fit. The breathable factor is also not a consideration since both materials used seem not to be breathable but more water resistant.

11862 14258 2 1 2 Neither of these shoes has a pointy toe. Shoe B has a very blunt, square toe, though, so I guess Shoe A is pointier.
11862 14258 2 2 2 Both seem equally pointy, but dress shoes, like Shoe B, seem more pointy than sneakers all things being equal.
11695 42147 2 2 1 Its toe is more angular.

7905 2277 2 2 3 Both are open toed sandles. Neither are pointed.

17482 3445 2 1 1 Neither is pointy, but shoe A is slightly less rounded
17482 3445 2 2 2 Neither is really pointy, but I chose B since it is enclosed.
17482 3445 2 2 1 Shoe A is a flip flop, and so basically anything will have a more pointy toe.

42106 30878 3 1 1 better sole

48088 4138 3 2 1 Shoe B would be better suited than A for sport activity, although neither shoe is sporty
48088 4138 3 1 1 Shoe A is more dressier, more pointier, and the buckle is more noticeable. Sporty as in flashy, would be Shoe A over Shoe B.
48088 4138 3 1 2 I selected Shoe A simply because shoe B is a dress shoe.
48088 4138 3 2 1 The shoe seems more rugged.
20650 18490 3 2 1 A looks like it could be a slipper
20650 18490 3 2 1 Shoe A is a casual shoe, but Shoe B are sporty-looking flip flops from Quicksilver, which is a surf-style brand.

44262 650 3 2 1 B is more colorful and sporty looking; A looks dressy.
44262 650 3 2 1 The silver shoe, A, is more delicate, and the color, silver, also loans itself to a more formal or less active wearing occasion. The red shoe seems sturdier and more likely to stand up to an active day of walking, etc.
262 38815 3 2 1 Neither is sporty but she B appears less useful.
262 38815 3 2 3 Neither of these shoes supports an active lifestyle.

42720 25281 3 2 1 Shoe b is less dressy then shoe a.
42720 25281 3 2 1 Shoe A has a stiletto heal, which does not indicate sporty whereas shoe be looks like a cowboy boot.
42720 25281 3 2 1 The stiletto heel on shoe A is too high and sharp to be considered sporty

34813 16099 3 2 1 Shoe A has a heal and Shoe B does not. 
34813 16099 3 2 2 A has a heel.
34813 16099 3 2 1 I will have to say the shoe that is lower and looks more comfortable is more sporty.
34813 16099 3 2 1 Shoe A has a heel which would not be conducive to sports activities.
3423 29823 3 2 2 B looks durable for action movements
3423 29823 3 1 3 Would not use sporty to describe either of these, but I chose shoe A because you can wear shoe A while boating, a kind of sport, but you generally only wear shoe B when you have to trudge through some snow/slush/cold, wet environment for some extended period of time, and not in a fun way.
3423 29823 3 2 2 colors and tread
3423 29823 3 1 1 B is ugly

20212 47762 3 1 1 Shoe a is less formal then shoe b.
20212 47762 3 2 2 Shoe B looks easier to work in and run than Shoe A
20212 47762 3 1 2 Shoe A, while not exactly what I would describe as sporty, definitely has a much more sporty look than Shoe B and also looks a great deal more comfortable, which I think is essential to something being sporty.
20212 47762 3 1 1 Shoe A is slightly more sporty
16144 30741 3 2 2 Shoe B looks more versatile and durable for outdoor events.
16144 30741 3 2 1 B looks like a dance shoe

16144 30741 3 1 2 The strap will keep your feet in more secure.
34394 39836 3 1 1 Shoe A looks more like a modern sports shoe.
34394 39836 3 1 2 Shoe A has better sole

48505 10024 3 2 3 neither
48505 10024 3 2 1 Shoe A would be impossible to do anything sporty in.
48505 10024 3 2 2 again, neither are very sporty, but shoe a is the least sporty of the two choices.
48505 10024 3 1 2 Between the two shoe A is easier to run in and shoe B would fall off and be no help at all. 
48505 10024 3 2 3 Neither are sporty at all.
42886 46601 3 2 2 B at least has a sandal aspect to it
42886 46601 3 1 3 Neither show is sporty as they are both formal wear with heels
42886 46601 3 1 3 Neither are sporty. 
42886 46601 3 1 1 Shoe B is meant to be sexy
42886 46601 3 1 1 Shoe B is more for fancy dress than shoe A.
31195 15 3 2 1 Shoe B resembles a riding boot, and is therefore more sporty.  
31195 15 3 2 2 shoe B is made of a more sturdy construction and looks like it could be used around livestock and horses
31195 15 3 2 2 Looks more functional.
31195 15 3 1 1 looks to have tread 
31195 15 3 1 2 Shoe B looks more stylish
49109 40817 3 1 1 Shoe B looks like it's made of rabbit fur inside.
49109 40817 3 1 1 This one's easy - Shoe B is far too dressy.
49109 40817 3 1 1 Shoe B is lined with a fluffy material, edged with a scrunched up material, and topped with a seemingly decorative shoestring bow. Shoe A at least appears more solid and the upward curve of the front of Shoe A implies action. 
49109 40817 3 1 1 B is more a lounging shoe
49109 40817 3 1 1 I would be more likely to wear shoe A for something sporty than Shoe B and I believe it would look better with sports clothing than shoe B.
10436 21158 3 1 1 Shoe a has more uses for activities then shoe b.
10436 21158 3 1 1 SHOE A LOOKS TO BE A RUNNING SHOE.
10436 21158 3 1 1 Shoe A appears to be multipurpose where Shoe A looks for running only.
10436 21158 3 2 2 Tennis shoe vs hiking shoe, it's preference really.
10436 21158 3 2 1 The Nike logo is often associated with being sporty
48493 47044 3 1 1 shoe a is stronger, thicker so more sporty
48493 47044 3 1 2 Shoe A because it has a thicker sole
48493 47044 3 1 1 It just looks more sporty
48493 47044 3 2 2 Neither shoe is sporty in an athletic sense, neither is suitable for sports as far as I can tell. Shoe A just looks trashy to me, not sporty. Shoe B is sporty in the more preppy usage of the word sporty, in so far that it could easily go with an outfit that would be called casual and sporty. 
48493 47044 3 1 2 Shoe B is much more of a fashion shoe, which makes shoe A sportier by default.
39892 21602 3 2 1 Shoe A is a dressier shoe with a pointier heel.

4783 34423 3 2 2 Shoe B seems to be a little more contoured
4783 34423 3 1 2 It's tough to tell whether Shoe B is a high top sneaker or a snow boot.  Shoe A looks like a standard sneaker.  
4783 34423 3 2 1 B just has the feel of an athletic shoe, designed for anything from basketball to hiking
4783 34423 3 2 3 They feel equally sporty to me.

5747 20725 3 2 2 Shoe B has that looked

5747 20725 3 2 2 Shoe A looks closer to the ground and has no laces.
5747 20725 3 2 2 Only because a mens shoe grips the foot better
41827 10908 3 2 2 Lower heel

9309 5760 3 1 1 Shoe a is less formal then shoe b.
9309 5760 3 1 2 Heels aren't very sporty

43637 276 3 2 2 Appears more comfortable
43637 276 3 2 2 Actually neither of these shoes would classify as sporty. Shoe A is more of a special event i.e. Church or Dining Out kind of shoe and is not suitable nor comfortable to perform any kind of sport in. Shoe B I chose as more sporty than Shoe A due to the fact that I perceive it to have a rubber sole at the bottom, making it more safe (to at least walk on a surface floor as a gym, for example) and also to maneuver more easily on hard surfaces when moving about. Shoe B would not be a safe sporty shoe due to it easily coming off because it's a slip on shoe. Both would be very unsafe overall if these were the only choices to choose from for working out in. 
43637 276 3 2 2 It does not have a heel, and is not a work shoe
48990 15849 3 1 1 Shoe B is a slipper, the least sporty on the Shoe Spectrum.

23364 11889 3 1 2 More supportive
23364 11889 3 1 1 very sporty

34245 42805 3 2 2 Heels aren't very sporty
34245 42805 3 2 3 Shoe A is a dress shoe and shoe B looks like a snow shoe. I choose Shoe B because of its use in the snow and I perceive being in the snow as an activity requiring sporty footwear.
34245 42805 3 2 3 I would most likely run in shoe B rather than shoe A
34245 42805 3 1 2 Because shoes A are heels and are uncomfortable
34245 42805 3 2 1 While it doesn't appear very sporty, shoe B looks easier to do sporty activities in than a heel
1737 27061 3 1 1 Shoe A just looks more sporty to me than B, B would be a bit more dressy.
1737 27061 3 1 2 More supportive

28963 12176 3 1 1 Shoe A is fitted with a more rugged sole
28963 12176 3 1 1 Shoe B is very casual so it can't be sporty.
35614 40036 3 1 1 I think you could be more athletic (sporty) in shoe A than you can in shoe B
35614 40036 3 1 1 Shoe a is lighter with less treads on the bottom.  Shoe B is a work shoe.
35614 40036 3 1 1 A is a lot less formal than B
35614 40036 3 2 3 Neither shoe is at all sporty. A looks like it would fall off and B looks too stiff to move around in.

4425 7357 3 2 1 neither really looks sporty but i think it would be harder to be sporty in shoe a then shoe b
4425 7357 3 2 1 A had a heal and would not be considered sporty. 
4425 7357 3 2 1 A has a heel.
4425 7357 3 1 2 Hard to say, but shoe B looks too flimsy to do anything sporty in.
4425 7357 3 1 1 Neither are particularly sporty, but shoe B looks like it would fall apart if wet or muddy (shoe A is more durable).

8560 17575 3 1 1 Shoe a is for snow sports.
8560 17575 3 1 1 Shoe doesn't have a high heel like b.
8560 17575 3 1 1 Shoe A appears less formal than shoe B, therefore sportier.  
8560 17575 3 1 1 Shoe A has a flat, thicker sole
8560 17575 3 1 2 Shoe A seems sportier only because Shoe B seems dressier.
42772 44463 3 1 1 winter sports

42772 44463 3 1 1 Looks like a snow boot.

37500 32950 3 1 1 Pretty explicitly a sports shoe.
37500 32950 3 1 1 The buckle and leather like material of shoe B give it a very formal appearance when compared to shoe A. Shoe A's shape is and flat sole make it seem suitable for a basketball court. 
37500 32950 3 1 1 B looks dressier
37500 32950 3 1 1 Shoe A looks like it was made for outdoor wear so I picked it instead of shoe B which apears more dressy.

21354 8498 3 2 1 The embellishments on Shoe A and the heel make it less sporty than the more plain and flat Shoe B.

36676 12683 3 1 1 Shoe B is ugly
36676 12683 3 2 1 b is suited for outdoor activities
41865 40982 3 1 1 Shoe A has more cushion, and less of a heel, therefore making it more sporty.  
41865 40982 3 1 1 In my opinion shoe A is sportier because I don't necessarily like brown boots
41865 40982 3 1 2 This is tough because they're knee high boots, but Shoe A seems more sporty.  The leather doesn't match sporty.
41865 40982 3 2 1 Shoe B has a more sport look to it. The lining in the shoe A makes me think comfort and not sporty. 
41865 40982 3 2 1 Shoe B's material is more strain resistant. 
47079 19511 3 1 2 A looks like it was designed with a specific sport in mind

3147 39350 3 1 3 neither
3147 39350 3 1 1 Shoe A has a lower heel
3147 39350 3 2 1 wedge style shoes are in fashion today and B is hot because it is a masculine, leather oxford style shoe that has been feminized with the wedge. I would definitely buy these.
3147 39350 3 1 1 you would break your ankles in B 
37442 32018 3 2 2 Shoe B seems more like a work boot and would seem more active than the Shoe A.
37442 32018 3 1 1 a is sportier

2893 42940 3 2 1 Shoe A has a heel, there is nothing sporty about it. At least with Shoe B, if you needed to run, there's no heel, so you would have the option. Shoe A is only worn with super dressy clothes.
2893 42940 3 2 1 Between the two, shoe B is more sporty because it has no heel and no straps.
2893 42940 3 2 1 shoe B isn't a high heel
2893 42940 3 2 2 Neither of the shoes seem sporty, but you could more easily run in Shoe B than Shoe A because of heels.
2893 42940 3 2 1 The heels make it impossible to consider shoe A sporty.

7278 24294 3 2 1 Athletic shoes are more versatile and sporty.
7278 24294 3 2 1 because they are made for running 
14601 30325 3 1 1 Shoe a is more durable for activities.

14601 30325 3 1 2 Neither shoe is sporty but Shoe B is a slipper so I chose Shoe A 
14601 30325 3 2 1 I really dont think you could easily run in Shoe A
14447 39626 3 2 1 Shoe A looks like it would be worn by a very uptight person.  Shoe B is more relaxed and rugged looking; more friendly.
14447 39626 3 2 2 Shoe B appears to have a thicker, sturdier sole
14447 39626 3 1 2 A looks like a military boot.

7020 49773 3 2 2 Sandals are sportier than boots
7020 49773 3 2 2 Shoe A being a tall boot is not very sporty. 
45041 6321 3 1 2 More supportive
45041 6321 3 2 1 Shoe B is more of a hiking shoe where shoe A is a somewhat casual city walking shoe.
45041 6321 3 2 1 Shoe B is more for sport than Shoe A which is more for style.

25494 4223 3 2 1 Thinner
25494 4223 3 2 2 Shoe A might be a skate shoe, but because of the fashion, those are meant to be a little loose. Shoe B is more sports oriented because o the tightness and overall design. 
25494 4223 3 1 2 A is skate boarder type 
30212 23931 3 2 3 Shoe B looks more sporty but only in winter months.

23445 25111 3 1 3 Both shoes are equally sporty.  
11437 33381 3 1 2 Neither is sporty at all.  B has some 'zing' that might appeal to a sporty type.    But if you wanted to keep your feet safe in sporting activity A may be the better choice, so I went with A and only medium confidence.
11437 33381 3 2 1 Shoe B is more colorful than shoe A.
11437 33381 3 1 1 Shoe A more versatile and can be worn to more functions than shoe B. 
11437 33381 3 1 3 It is VERY hard to compare these shoes on their sporty attributes. Neither are sporty. 
11437 33381 3 1 1 Neither shoe is sporty, but shoe B is not made for outdoors

2809 16788 3 2 3 Both shoes dont look sporty at all but shoe A is defiantly a formal leather shoe which is definitely not sporty.
17662 20993 3 1 1 Shoe A is more of a generic sneaker with more arch support.
17662 20993 3 1 1 Shoe A is a running shoe
17662 20993 3 1 2 Shoe A looks like the running shoes I wear, so I'm biased towards thinking those are sportier - I've never seen people wear shoes like B to play sports.
17662 20993 3 1 1 Shoe A looks like a running shoe
17662 20993 3 1 1 Shoe A appears to have a more natural fit and better support for the arch
6128 39195 3 2 2 More supportive
6128 39195 3 2 2 Shoe B appears slightly more secure.
6128 39195 3 2 2 B looks to be more sporty, even though they both appear to be slipper shoes of some sort. 
6128 39195 3 2 3 Both shoes can't fit a sporty type look, but shoe B could possibly pass more of sporty look since the opening stops at the ankles, Shoe A is a boot that extends upwards covering the ankles making Shin Splints more possible (in my opinion) than shoe B.
6128 39195 3 2 1 Again, neither, but I don't know of many sports that can be played with shoes that high.
5123 17039 3 2 2 B looks like it will stay on the foot during action movements
5123 17039 3 1 2 A would be OK for beach sports
5123 17039 3 2 1 Shoe b is sporty beacuse it has more areas to support the foot (straps) to keep on the foot

28098 3259 3 1 1 Shoe A doesn't come up as high on the leg, looks more weather-proof, and has a better sole for traction than Shoe B. Shoe A would be much more comfortable to wear doing sporty activities.

28098 3259 3 1 1 A is more colorful.
20798 27222 3 2 2 Shoe B is slightly sportier than shoe A.

20798 27222 3 1 2 A has a bottom that looks great for hiking and rain. Shoe B does look kind of sporty, but I couldn't imagine doing a sport in them.
45942 45029 3 1 1 Shoe A would be easier to do any sport it while shoe B would be impossible due to the heel
45942 45029 3 1 1 Shoe A is a more sporty shoe because it would be easier to move around in due to the flat heel of the shoe.
45942 45029 3 1 1 High heels cannot be considered sporty. 
45942 45029 3 1 1 Again, neither shoe is sporty at all. Shoe B is very dressy and would be hard to walk in. Shoe A is really just a slipper, but would still be a better choice if you need a sporty shoe.
45942 45029 3 1 1 Comfortable looking flats are always more sporty than heels.
24156 23241 3 1 1 Being a hiking boot, I would consider Shoe A to be more sporty.
24156 23241 3 1 1 shoe A is more sporty. one can wear with jeans.
24156 23241 3 2 2 I think shoe B is more sporty because it looks sleeker due to not having laces and hardware (like the metal lace holes in shoe A)
24156 23241 3 1 1 Rugged for outdoor activities.
24156 23241 3 1 1 Shoe A looks like a hiking boot.

6529 2095 3 1 2 neither are very sporty, however shoe a covers less of the leg
6529 2095 3 1 2 A would look good with blue jeans... not much differentiation but enough.
6529 2095 3 1 3 Not sure how sporty either is really, but b is probably a lot more functional.

2490 39508 3 2 3 Neither shoe is sporty
2490 39508 3 2 3 neither is sporty, by the shoe spectrum, but If i had to choose, i would say the one with the thicker heal is more sporty. I certainly would not want to run or do anything sport like in a spike heal.
2490 39508 3 1 1 It looks sporty
2490 39508 3 2 2 Shoe B looks easier to move around in with the shorter thicker heel.
35615 33396 3 1 1 Shoe A's sole is more suited to sport activities
35615 33396 3 1 1 B looks very constricting. 
35615 33396 3 1 1 A looks like a hiking shoe. B is just a winter boot.

35615 33396 3 1 1 while neither are extremely sporty, shoe a is much more so than b due to appearance and lower profile on the ankle/leg
13361 37115 3 2 2 Shoe B is designed for outdoor activities
13361 37115 3 2 1 shoe B at least wont fall off
13361 37115 3 2 2 A looks like you could go out in snow/rain and walk around or hike. A looks more like a lounging shoe.

27377 24502 3 1 1 Style B is a dress boot, so not sporty at all while Shoe A has some fancy decorations on it but is still a cowboy boot.
27377 24502 3 1 1 A looks like it can be worn for some snow sports
27377 24502 3 2 1 Shoe B has a lower heel and thicker sole, but neither shoe is sporty

37325 5320 3 1 1 Show A looks to be designed for athletics
37325 5320 3 2 2 Shoe B is more practical to wear on an everyday basis and looks sporty oppose to Shoe A seems like it would only be worn when playing sports.

36823 23763 3 1 2 The soul has more traction.
36823 23763 3 2 2 This one was hard to decide, but shoe B is the sportier of the two. I give it the most sporty because it appears to be a shoe made for sports like skateboarding. Option A is more of a general casual shoe.

48877 26354 3 1 2 Lighter
48877 26354 3 1 1 Both shoes aren't meant for sports, but if you attempted to run or try any athletic activity with shoe A, the straps would hold your foot into place and prevent the shoe from falling off.

47492 45647 3 1 1 NICE CONTRAST IN COLORS.

47492 45647 3 1 1 Shoe A covers more of a foot so would probably stay on better for sporty activities

9697 13193 3 1 1 B almost looks like rain boots.
9697 13193 3 1 2 Shoe A looks like a hiking boot while Shoe B looks more like a work boot so therefore I consider A to appear more sporty.
9697 13193 3 2 1 Shoe B has better support and appears to be a lighter shoe
9697 13193 3 1 1 Shoe B is a classic duck boot.  There is nothing sporty about that.

4912 43699 3 2 1 A is not appropriate for any kind of athletics at all
4912 43699 3 1 1 The red heels are far more sporty than the  grandma-esque sandal.

25731 12900 3 2 1 Although neither are strictly sporty, shoe B being an insulated camp shoe is more sporty given its connection with outdoors use.

44293 15725 3 2 1 sporty red
44293 15725 3 1 2 No heel. Neither are sporty at all.

34980 26133 3 1 1 No sport can be completed in clogs. 
34980 26133 3 2 2 Shoe B is a slipper type shoe which really is very sporty but it would be more comfortable for sporty activities than Shoe A, the cowboy boot.

6779 34774 3 2 2 the soles look easy to move around

33236 48615 3 2 1 Shoe b is less formal then show a.

43575 9451 3 1 1 I again would not ware shoe B in public.
43575 9451 3 1 1 Neither shoe is particularly comfy looking, but given that both are flat, Shoe B looks far too much like lounge wear to ever be considered sporty. Shoe A looks more like something you could run in... if you had to.

44299 44769 3 2 1 shoe vs slipper easy

19236 33477 3 2 3 Both shoes are sporty, but shoe A can only be worn while playing a sport. When I think of the word sporty, I think of something that is athletic looking but can be worn at any time.

18688 33205 3 1 2 Shoe B looks like it is made of a very soft, fuzzy material, which would stain if taken out of doors and may not offer good support. Shoe A looks it like withstand the elements better, making it more suitable for sports.

37032 32761 4 2 1 Shoe B I would assume is a lot warmer and weather resistant, and Shoe A has very shiny leather, which unless it's patent leather, is very cheap and uncomfortable leather.
